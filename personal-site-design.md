Purpose of my site:

This site will act as my portfolio and CV for when I have finished the Dev Academy course and am lookig for freelance work. It needs to showcase my abilities as a web developer and also a bit of my personality with personal blog posts. It needs to be easy to use and navigate and really slick design-wise.

Target audience:

Potential and existing clients

Intended interaction and experience with site:

I would like people visitng my site to get a snapshot of my skills and the sort of work I produce, but also to get an insight into my personality, while still keeping it professional. I would like the site to be clean and really visually appealling but also a bit fun!

How to build site:

In order for my site to showcase my skills properly, it will need to be structurally sound, with a few added cool features, visually appealling in both layout, colour scheme and typography, and I'm thinking I will need some animations in there to add an element of fun, so will utilise some javascript.
